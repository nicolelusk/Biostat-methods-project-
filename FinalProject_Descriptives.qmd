### Research Question and Variables to be Included

How does fasting influence insulin and cholesterol levels in adult men and women? 

In our final project we will look at gender, length of food fast (hours), length of coffee/tea fast (hours),

We will be assessing two continuous outcome variables outcome, insulin and cholesterol 

```{r}
library("here")
library("haven")
Demographics<-read_xpt(here("DEMO_L.xpt"))
Fasting<-read_xpt(here("FASTQX_L.xpt"))
Insulin<-read_xpt(here("INS_L.xpt"))
Cholesterol<-read_xpt(here("TCHOL_L.xpt"))
Diabetes<-read_xpt(here("DIQ_L.xpt"))
```


### Single Variable Visualizations

Numerical and graphical descriptions for each variable 

### Bivariate Visualization 

Variables Jointly, bivariate between dependent and outcome 


### Summary of Trends Observed so far
